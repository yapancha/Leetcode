# LeetCode Problem Solving Blueprint

This repository serves as a guide for solving LeetCode problems efficiently using data structures and algorithms. The main goal is to provide a systematic approach to problem-solving by categorizing problems based on their characteristics and recommending appropriate data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures Reference Guide**: Describes various data structures and their usage scenarios, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, tries, and more.

2. **Algorithms Reference Guide**: Covers essential algorithms for sorting, searching, tree and graph traversal, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, string manipulation, and miscellaneous tasks.

3. **Decision Patterns**: Offers quick decision patterns to choose the right data structure or algorithm based on specific problem requirements.

4. **Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms**: Outlines a step-by-step approach to solving LeetCode problems, from identifying the problem category to implementing and optimizing solutions.

## Usage

1. Refer to the Data Structures and Algorithms Reference Guide to understand the characteristics and usage scenarios of different data structures and algorithms.

2. Use the Decision Patterns section as a quick reference to select the most suitable data structure or algorithm for a given problem statement.

3. Follow the Problem Solving guidelines to systematically approach and solve LeetCode problems using the recommended data structures and algorithms.
